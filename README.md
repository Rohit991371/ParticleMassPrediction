# Particle Mass Prediction using CNN & EfficientNet 

This project trains a **CNN model using EfficientNet** to predict the mass of particles from image matrices.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of **125x125 image matrices** with 4 channels (`Track pT`, `DZ`, `D0`, `ECAL`).
- The target variable is `am` (mass of the particle).
- You can download the datasets from the following links:

## Model Architecture
- Uses **EfficientNetB0** as the feature extractor.
- A custom CNN model is also available.
- The output layer is a **single neuron (regression)** to predict mass.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation
